# JeParticipe


## What is it ?
JeParticipe is a web platform made with in python (flask) to create and answer short one-question surveys.
This is basically a vote platform.
Like any social media, Jeparticipe has it's own following/followers system, profiles and user verification process.

## What's the goal of this project
I want to make it easier to ask opinion inside enterprises or public institutions...
The goal is to make a very attractive platform where you can scroll between short surveys and answer to it by a single tap, to maximize audience. The easier it is, the more people come to answer your surveys ;) 


### a demo is available on [my little server](https://www.jeparticipe.tk)
